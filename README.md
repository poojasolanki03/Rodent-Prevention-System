# Rodent-Prevention-System

 Rodents pose a significant threat to vehicles, causing extensive damage and safety
 hazards. In response, we introduce a pioneering solution: rodent prevention system,
 tailored for vehicle use during rest periods. This device integrates advanced sensors
 capable of detecting rodent activity and precisely locating the affected area. Upon
 detection, the system swiftly alerts the vehicle owner, enabling immediate
 intervention. Moreover, the Rodent Controller employs innovative techniques,
 including the emission of deterrent ultrasonic waves and a buzzer, effectively
 repelling rodents and preventing further damage. Through proactive monitoring, entry
 point sealing, and swift repairs, our comprehensive approach ensures vehicles remain
 safeguarded, providing owners with peace of mind during idle periods.
